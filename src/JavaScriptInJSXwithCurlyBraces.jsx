				JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping
				rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want
				to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside
				that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to
				open a window to JavaScript.
